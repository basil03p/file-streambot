    The main issue was using bot.id instead of bot.me.id
    This has been fixed in the following files:
    - FileStream/bot/plugins/stream.py
    - FileStream/utils/multi_bot_manager.py
    
    Key changes made:
    1. Changed all instances of processing_bot.id to processing_bot.me.id
    2. Changed all instances of bot.id to bot.me.id in comparisons
    3. Added error handling for min() function in multi_bot_manager
    4. Added fallback mechanisms for edge cases
