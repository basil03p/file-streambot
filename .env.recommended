# ===== RECOMMENDED CHANNEL CONFIGURATION =====

# OPTION 1: Separate channels (Recommended)
# This gives you better control and clearer separation of logs

# File storage and logs (multi-bots admin required)
FLOG_CHANNEL=-1002531606586
# User activity logs (main bot admin only)  
ULOG_CHANNEL=-1002531606587  # Different channel for user logs

# Force Subscribe
FORCE_SUB_ID=-1002036635078
FORCE_SUB=true
FORCE_UPDATES_CHANNEL=true

# Enhanced Channel Features
AUTH_CHANNEL=-1002036635078
GENERATE_DOWNLOAD_LINKS=true

# ===== ALTERNATIVE: Same channel setup =====
# If you want to use the same channel for both (current setup)
# Then main bot needs admin access, and it will handle both file and user logs

# FLOG_CHANNEL=-1002531606586
# ULOG_CHANNEL=-1002531606586  # Same as FLOG_CHANNEL

# In this case:
# - Main bot handles ULOG_CHANNEL messages
# - Multi-bots handle FLOG_CHANNEL file operations  
# - Both send to same channel but with different purposes
